Mode 22
================================
at caf 0
at sh 7e0
TX:	03 22 00 0c		Request  - request for pid 000C (RPM). 
RX:	7E8 05 62 00 0C XX YY	Response - two bytes of RPM data!


Diagnostic Codes
===============================
===============================

Transmission response to 02 01 00 
7EA 06 41 00 80 00 00 01 AA 	= Bitmask of supported pids: 41 00 80 00 00 01

Engine ECU response to 02 01 00
7E8 06 41 00 BE 3F B8 13 AA 	= Bitmask of supported pids: 41 00 BE 3F B8 13


AT SH 243		= Set header to talk to Transmission
01 3E			= Tester Present
03 A9 81 02		= mode A9, read DTCs? 

Sending from one window, I ran AT MT in another window and captured the following. 
	>at mt 43			<-- I'll be sending to 243, which I think is the Transmission. 
	243 02 01 0C 00 00 00 00 00 	<-- my request for mode 1 PID 0c (RPMs)
	643 03 7F 01 11 00 00 00 00 
	243 01 3E 00 00 00 00 00 00 	<-- My request - tester present
	643 01 7E 00 00 00 00 00 00 
	243 03 A9 81 02 00 00 00 00 	<-- My request - DTCs?
	543 81 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 

AT SH 241 (Engine?)
	>at mt 41
	241 01 3E 00 00 00 00 00 00 	<-- My request (tester present)
	641 01 7E 00 00 00 00 00 00 
	241 03 A9 81 02 00 00 00 00 	<-- My request (get DTCs?)
	541 81 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 


Second try: 
AT SH 241
03 A9 81 12
	>at mt 41
	241 01 3E 00 00 00 00 00 00

	241 03 A9 81 12 00 00 00 00 
	541 81 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 	<-- Response indicates "no codes are present". 




Broadcast DPIDS
===============================
===============================


Programming the ELM327 to capture the responses 
===============================================
* The following commands will program the ELM327 to 

AT H1 		- print headers in responses. 
AT CAF 0	- CAN Auto-formatting OFF
AT L1		- linefeeds ON in responess. 
AT SH 7E0	- set transmit header
AT CM 5FF	- set CAN Filter MASK
AT CF 7E8	- set CAN filter 
AT ST 85	- This one sets the timeout for waiting for multiple responess. (FF=1 second, 85= about half a second). 
01 3E		- tester present
04 2C FB 00 0C	- define DPID FB to send PID 0C (request for engine RPM)
03 AA 03 FB	- start broadcasting DPID FB at medium rate(03) or fast rate (04)


Impala SS 
7EA		- Transmission
7E8		- Engine



Sample responses
-------------------
5E8 FB 09 53 00 00 00 00 00 
5E8 FB 09 4D 00 00 00 00 00 
5E8 FB 09 5A 00 00 00 00 00 
5E8 FB 09 6A 00 00 00 00 00 
5E8 FB 09 7C 00 00 00 00 00 
7E8 01 60 AA AA AA AA AA AA 




Experimentation Notes
========================

* Create a DPID FE with just RPM and MAF
  06 2C FE 00 0C 00 10 00 
  06 2C 90 00 0E 00 0C
  04 2C FB 00 0E = request out of range
  04 2C FB 00 0C
  06 2C 20 00 0C 00 10
  04 2C 20 00 0E


* assuming that command worked and created DPID FE, then to activate it at low rate: 
  03 AA 02 FE
  03 AA 03 90
  03 AA 02 0C -- results in interesting things...
  04 aa 01 fd fe -- works - just sends those two dpids once each. 
  03 AA 02 FB
  03 AA 02 0F
  03 AA 02 20
  05 AA 02 0C 0D 0E


  03 aa 02 FA = request out of range (641 03 7F AA 31 00 00 00 00) 
  * So we have slots FB-FE (four of them). 

  06 AA 03 FB FC FD FE = this works - it streams, quite quickly, all four slots. 



* Fails with no response - because I didn't create DPIDs 03, 30 and 10?
  04 AA 03 30 10

 
So what is this weird response I keep getting: 
241 01 3E 00 00 00 00 00 00 
641 01 7E 2C 31 00 00 00 00 = request out of range, or security not granted. 

241 03 AA 03 80 00 00 00 00 = request that DPID 80 be sent and repeated. 
641 03 7F AA 31 00 00 00 00 = request out of range

241 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 
641 03 7F 01 11 00 00 00 00  = service (01) not supported.

7EA 01 7E AA AA AA AA AA AA  = OK I'll start sending the DPID broadcasts NOW.
